;;;   25/11/2019 The system is ported to SBCL (bye GUI)
;;;   10/12/2009 The system is ASDF instalable
;;;   21/01/2009 File lecture is done without using grep. It is not
;;;              necessary anymore to use trivial-shell
;;;   19/01/2009 Verifies if the arff files exists before loading it
;;;   19/01/2009 It works in Lispworks 5.1.2
;;;   10/07/2008 The package uses split-sequence and trivial-shell to read ARFF
;;;   01/02/2007 The package works with ARFF files as input

;;;   11/03/2007 It runs in OpenMCL and LispWorks 5.0
